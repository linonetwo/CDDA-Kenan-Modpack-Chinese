### Greetings from the PM World mod team!

This mod adds a variety of content from the Project Moon games, namely from games such as Lobotom Corporation, Library of Ruin and Limbus Company.
We strive to convey the experience of these in CDDA; in the mod you will be able to meet familiar characters, familiar places and mechanics. **This mod created for experimental branch of CDDA!**

### Fight the manifestation of sin's!

The mod adds peccatulums, they will appear on par with other zombies, but over time there will be more of them
Each of them has their own special attack patterns and you will have to figure out how to deal with them.

### Interact with the factions and choose the one you like!

Currently 4 factions have been added:

*Zwei Association Fixers (South Section 6)*

*Kurokumo Clan*

*Rusty Chain Gang*

*Remnants of Lobotomy Corporation*

### 3 martial arts styles and faction equipment!

As you complete missions and increase your trust level, you will be able to purchase unique faction gear and learn their unique fighting style, further increasing your lethality with that faction's chosen weapon.

### Several unique anomalies!

Some have escaped, some are still waiting for their time. Each one will give you unique combat experience! You should not underestimate their level of danger, because you are still (for now) a ordinary person. In the future, you will have the opportunity to get E.G.O from defeated anomalies, but for now, adapt and gain combat experience

### FAQ

Q: ***Will other factions, anomalies, items, etc. be added in the future?***

A: *Of course! I'm a huge fan of what I'm working on, and I'd like to add as much as possible. But my priority is integrity and complexity. The development of the mod will be divided into "Cycles", each of which will focus on a specific large fragment of development, and at its end it will be decided what to add next. The decision will be made personally by me, but I will definitely ask and find out what the players would like!*


Q: ***I don't like X part of the mod, could I remove it from the game?***

A: *When the mod is big enough I will make it modular, and you will be able to choose what to connect to it (factions, anomalies, mechanics)*


Q: ***I got acquainted with this mod earlier but its release time was too long, why?***

A: *The fact is that our team lives mainly in Ukraine, and due to military actions, missile attacks, power outages and other related problems, we could not maintain a stable development rhythm, which led to the current situation. We are very sorry and thank you for your understanding!*


Q: ***I like your mod! Could I join your team?***

A: *Of course! It would help us a lot. For this, please contact me personally. You need motivation and preferably knowledge of Json, and what you don't know, we will teach you.*
